# 2024 India election research project

This repository contains compiled datasets, reports, and summaries relating to the **2024 Indian General Elections**, focusing on Lok Sabha member data. The data is sourced primarily from the **Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)** and manually curated datasets for analysis purposes. The data has a focus on occupational analyses, and as a result, has codings for different occupation types. However, this repo serves as an ongoing and expanded data source for personal and asset data for members of the Lok Sabha
